Notes and thoughts on Project Euler problem 8:

For ease of use/scalability the large digit number will need to be read in
~~See 1000digit.txt

~~~~Top lines has large numbers: [rows, clomuns, length] for use during reading.  immediatly following that is the large digit length

The problem given states that we need to use 13 adjacent digits which when multipled together yeild the largest result.  We can view this selection of 13 digits as a lens of length "n" to be used on a large number with "N" digits

With this in mind we observe several factors of note:
1. the length of search will be going from 0 to N-n, any father and we will have a number with less than "n" digits, 13 in this case
2. if a 0 should appead in the right most position "r", the 13th digit, then the result of this scan AND the next "n-1" scans will be 0, meaning we can adjust the currrent starting index to "r+n"
2a. for cases where multiple 0 appear when adjusting the lowest index to "r+n", a search will need to be done to determine if the newly reset range contains any 0.  If this case appears the right-most index which contains a 0 "r" shall be used and the process shall repeat
